# Decisions

Each entry records a choice, its reason, and what it rules out.

## 001 — SQLite as the database

- **Decision:** use SQLite through `better-sqlite3`, stored in a file.
- **Reason:** one service, no extra container, enough for the testnet stage. Keeps `docker compose up` simple.
- **Rules out:** Postgres and Redis for now. Add them only when a later prompt shows a need.

## 002 — Plain SQL migrations

- **Decision:** numbered `.sql` files in `backend/migrations/`, applied in order by `backend/src/migrate.js`. Each one is recorded in `schema_migrations` and runs once.
- **Reason:** no ORM to learn or maintain, and the schema is visible in one place.
- **Rule:** never edit a migration that has been applied. Add a new numbered file instead.

## 003 — Secrets at rest are hashed with HMAC-SHA256

- **Decision:** OTP codes and claim tokens are stored only as `HMAC-SHA256(HMAC_SECRET, value)`.
- **Reason:** a copy of the database alone does not reveal a valid code or token.
- **Rule:** never store a plain code or token in any table, log, or event payload.

## 004 — WAL mode and foreign keys

- **Decision:** the connection uses `journal_mode = WAL` and `foreign_keys = ON`.
- **Reason:** WAL lets readers run while a write is in progress. Foreign keys are off by default in SQLite and would silently allow broken references.

## 005 — The database is opened in one module

- **Decision:** only `backend/src/db.js` opens the connection. Startup runs pending migrations.
- **Reason:** one place to change connection settings, and one place to close it in tests.
